## Projects

Below is a list of selected projects. Source code for additional projects and exercises can be found on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/joshuamjaxon). For more recent programs developed as a part of my academic work, please reach out to me through LinkedIn below.

[WikiCharts](http://joshuamjaxon.github.io/midterm-mashup) is a simple in-browser tool to view the makeup of the most recent edits for any given Wikipedia article by user, date, and size. Implemented in Javascript with the Wikipedia and Google Charts APIs using custom HTML/CSS.

[xkcd Passwords](https://github.com/joshuamjaxon/xkcd-passwords) is a simple web app for generating easily remembered passwords using the xkcd framework outlined [here](https://xkcd.com/936/). Options to specify component word length and maximum password length, enable common substitutions and capitalization, and optimize for typing speed are included. Source code can be found at the provided link and the front end may be viewed on GitHub Pages, but the app back end is no longer active on Heroku. Implemented with Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

[Various machine learning exercises](https://github.com/joshuamjaxon/CS420) are also found on my GitHub page. These are small studies performed primarily with scikit-learn using seaborn visualizations geared towards understanding different machine learning models and techniques. A project studying whether various age groups may be classified based on their attitudes towards technology is included.
