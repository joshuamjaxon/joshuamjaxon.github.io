## Projects

Below is a list of selected interactable projects. Source code for additional projects and exercises can be found on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/joshuamjaxon).

[WikiCharts](http://joshuamjaxon.github.io/midterm-mashup) is a simple in-browser tool to view the makeup of the most recent edits for any given Wikipedia article by user, date, and size. Implemented in Javascript with the Wikipedia and Google Charts APIs using custom HTML/CSS.

[Winter is Coming](https://www.kongregate.com/games/joshuamjaxon/winter-is-coming) was my entry for the Ludum Dare 29 game jam. A team effort where I did the bulk of the programming in under 72 hours, the game tasks you with growing the best tree possible with the resources available. Cellular automata are used to produce a random grid allowing for a unique scenario each attempt. Implemented with Haxe using the HaxeFlixel library and compiled to Flash.
