I am a published experimental high energy physics graduate student researcher seeking to apply my data analysis and software development skills to well-motivated problems. I emphasize not only the extraction of data-driven quantitative results, but the translation of these results into meaningful and actionable real-world interpretations as well as the effective communication of these results to parties of all backgrounds and skill levels. I am particularly interested in the fields of physical science research, data science, software development, and similar, where my education and research experiences have left me well-equipped to hit the ground running.

Please peruse the available links to learn more about me and what I have done, and feel free to contact me via LinkedIn or email to discuss available opportunities.
